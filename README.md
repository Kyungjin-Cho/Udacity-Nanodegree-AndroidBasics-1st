This repository will be used for the '1st Project: Build a Single Screen App.'


## Project Overview

> Design and implement a single screen app that displays information about a fictional small business. Think along the lines of your favorite coffeeshop, local restaurant, or that gem of a store that sells those rare comic books or records.

## Suggested App Ideas

- Details about a small business in your neighborhood
- Contact info and description about your workplace or school
- Info about a special interest group (like a club or sports team) youâ€™re part of and how new members can sign up

## Requirements
- Business name
- At least one photo representing the business
- Two or more other pieces of information
